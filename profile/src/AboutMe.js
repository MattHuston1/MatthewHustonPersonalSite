        My name is Matthew and I love to code! <br/>My development journey started just six months ago when I started taking free online html/css courses. I've always been fascinated by computers but never gave any thought into coding. The first thing I learned was how to make a title tab, then learned how to write a simple phrase like "Hello World". This filled me with excitement and left me wanting more. I am now fully immersed into the development world and am loving every minute of it. <br/>Although computers hold a special place in my heart I have many other interests. I love all things outdoors! Skiing, rock climbing, hiking, rafting, fishing, camping, I love it all. <br/>I am also a huge music fanatic. I play guitar as well as a few other instruments. I've been to hundreds of concerts in many different states as well as in the Dominican Republic. The picture to the left is of my brother and I in the Dominican. I listen to many different genres but I mostly go to shows that have an emphasis on improvisation.
